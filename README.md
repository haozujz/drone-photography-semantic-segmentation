https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17TBFFrBNCclVe5F1OpI_CbscdgWIm0UA?usp=sharing

Semantic segmentation of drone aerial photography. Custom U-Net model.

## Potential updates:
- experiment with alternative loss functions eg. dice coef loss, jaccard loss, (sparse) cross-entropy loss, focal loss func (may perform better than weighted loss functions for multi-class tasks)

## Snippet:

Ground truth vs prediction:
